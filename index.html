    <h3><p>Summary</p></h3>
    <p>After 20 years of experience in banking and public administration, in 2023 I made the decision to change my direction at work. </p>
    <p>That's when I started to deal in detail with web development as a direction.</p>
    <p>My main goal was not just to get to know the front-end or back-end systems, but to reach the full-stack web developer level, 
       while paying special attention to the needs of my customers. Not only with a quality background, but also with an outstanding design.</p>
